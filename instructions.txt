What is SDLC?
The Software Development Life Cycle - A process that produces software with the highest quality, lowest cost, and shortest time possible

What are the stages of SDLC? explain 
1. Requirement Analysis - Identify what the task is and what it will do
2. Planning - Determine the cost and recources needed
3. Software Design - Figuring out and planning how you are going to actally code the software
4. Software Development - Actually creating the code/software
5. Testing - Test for defects and bugs and fix them
6 Deployment - Launch the product so users can use it

Define five SDLC moldels (methodology).
1. Waterfall Model - Finish one phase then move on to the next
2. Agile Model - Delivers a product very fast to get feedback from users and change as needed
3. Interative Model - Create a version very fast then keep testing and improving it
4. Big Bang Model - Doesnt really follow a process, just focuses everything on building the code/software
5. Spiral Model - Goes through planning, design, build and test over and over to keep improving

Take one of the SDLC models and explain the implementation process.


Describe how to apply SDLC model in the version control App.
